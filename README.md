# Hybrid_Machine
Development of a Hybrid Rapid Prototyping System Using 3D Printing Software and Arduino

Attention: This documentation is under construction. 

Here, you can find all documents to replicate the project. 

This machine was made to attain the title of electrical engineer, and with it, 
is possible made prototypes using hybrid manufacture, to save money no lost quality, 
using less manufacturing materials. 
It is possible combining the best qualities of technology additive and subtractive.

I'm so sorry, but, the paper was written in portuguese language, probably i'll write a version 
in English still in 2019. To help understand the questions of project and the difficulties found.

Thanks for reading and share your projects to.


Made in Brazil.
