# Hybrid_Machine
Development of a Hybrid Rapid Prototyping System Using 3D Printing Software and Arduino
Attention: This documentation is under construction.
Here, you can find all documents to replicate the project.
This machine was made to attain the title of electrical engineer, and with these documents is possible to make prototypes 
using hybrid manufacture, to save money no lost quality, and using fewer manufacturing materials. We have made it combining 
the best qualities of technology additive and subtractive.
I'm so sorry but the paper was written in the Portuguese language, probably I will write a new version in English still in 2020.

Thanks for reading and share your projects too.

Made in Brazil.
